This folder contains some of the data for teh cities experiment. Specifically, 
- worldcities.csv with license license.txt is the free city data base https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities.
- RandomCityGeneration.ipynb is the python notebook with which we generate random cities from the data and subsequently process the inferred cities.
- true_city_locations contains the spherical coordinates represented in R^3 of the random set of selected cities.
- inferred_city_locations_x.txt is the dataset with inferred city locations from CityExperiments using the first x cities of the dataset.
- rotated_city_locations_320.txt is the dataset with inferred city locations  using 320 cities, which were also rotated to obtain an optimal L_2 alignment to true locations.
